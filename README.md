asdf plugin add quarto
# or
asdf plugin add quarto https://github.com/lucaswilric/asdf-quarto.git
```

quarto:

```shell
# Show all installable versions
asdf list-all quarto

# Install specific version
asdf install quarto latest

# Set a version globally (on your ~/.tool-versions file)
asdf global quarto latest

# Now quarto commands are available
quarto --help
```
